      <h1>The Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma: Press-Dyson Interactive</h1>
      <h2>The Game</h2>
      <p>In each round, each of us can choose to cooperate or to defect.
      We play repeated rounds. In each round:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If we both cooperate, we both get <b>3&nbsp;points</b>.
        <li>If you cooperate and I defect, I get <b>5&nbsp;points</b> and you get <b>none</b>.
        <li>If you defect and I cooperate, you get <b>5&nbsp;points</b> and I get <b>none</b>.
        <li>If we both defect, we both get <b>1&nbsp;point</b>.
      </ul>
      
      <ol id="tabs">
        <li class="left"><a href="fixed.html">Fixed score</a>
        <li class="mid selected">Extortion
        <li class="right"><a href="titfer.html">Generous</a>
      </ol>
      <div id="tabbed">
        <p>In this game I will extort you. Your best strategy, if you want to maximise your
          own score, is to cooperate all the time – but then I will occasionally defect and
          so always do better than you.</p>
        <p>The only way you can avoid being taken advantage of is to resign yourself to the
          meagre rewards of mutual defection, and to defect on every turn. If you do anything
          else then I will take advantage of your cooperation and I will do three times better
          than you, in the sense that – on average over the long run –
          (my&nbsp;score minus 1) will be thrice (your&nbsp;score minus 1).</p>
        <div id="game">
          <form>
            Your move:
            <input type="submit" class="cooperate" name="x" value="Cooperate">
            <input type="submit" class="defect" name="x" value="Defect">
          </form>
          <div>Your average score: <span class="your-average-score"></span></div>
          <div>My average score: <span class="my-average-score"></span></div>
          <h3>History <a class="reset-game" href="#">new game</a></h3>

        </div>
        <script>$("#game").ipd([11/13,7/26,1/2,0]);</script>
      
        <h2>How does it work?</h2>
        <p>My play is based purely on how both of us played in the previous move:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If we both cooperated last time, then I cooperate with probability&nbsp;11/13.
          <li>If I cheated you last time (you cooperated and I defected), then I cooperate with probability&nbsp;7/26.
          <li>If you cheated me last time (I cooperated and you defected), then I cooperate with probability&nbsp;1/2.
          <li>If we both defected last time, I defect.
        </ul>
      
        <p>These probabilities are taken from <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/05/16/1206569109.full.pdf">Press and Dyson’s paper</a>, where this strategy appears as an example.</p>
