      <h1>The Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma: Press-Dyson Interactive</h1>
      <h2>The Game</h2>
      <p>In each round, each of us can choose to cooperate or to defect.
      We play repeated rounds. In each round:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If we both cooperate, we both get <b>3 points</b>.
        <li>If you cooperate and I defect, I get <b>5 points</b> and you get <b>none</b>.
        <li>If you defect and I cooperate, you get <b>5 points</b> and I get <b>none</b>.
        <li>If we both defect, we both get <b>1 point</b>.
      </ul>
    
      <ol id="tabs">
        <li class="left selected">Fixed score
        <li class="mid"><a href="extortion.html">Extortion</a>
        <li class="right"><a href="titfer.html">Generous</a>
      </ol>
      <div id="tabbed">
        <p>In this game, I’ve decided I want your average score to be 2.
          You’ll see that, however you play, after a few hundred moves your average
          score will be approximately 2.</p>

          </form>

          <h3>History <a class="reset-game" href="#">new game</a></h3>
          <div class="history">
          </div>
        </div>
        <script>$("#game").ipd([2/3,2/3,0,1/3]);</script>
      
        <h2>How does it work?</h2>
        <p>I am playing a very simple strategy in the game above.
        My play is based purely on how both of us played in the previous move:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If you cooperated last time, then I cooperate with probability 2/3.
          <li>If I cooperated and you defected, then this time I defect.
          <li>If we both defected last time, I cooperate with probability 1/3.
        </ul>
      
        <p>These probabilities were obtained by deciding I wanted your average score
          to be 2, and solving equations [8] and [9] in <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/05/16/1206569109.full.pdf">Press and Dyson’s paper</a>
          for a target score of 2.</p>
      
        <h2>Note</h2>
        <p>Although this strategy does belong to the new and interesting class of Press-Dyson
          strategies, it turns out that this particular type of Press-Dyson strategy
          (ones that force your opponent to have a particular fixed score, on average, however
          they play) was described earlier by Maarten C Boerlijst, Martin A Nowak and Karl Sigmund
          in their 1997 paper <a href="http://homepage.univie.ac.at/karl.sigmund/AMM97.pdf">Equal Pay for All Prisoners</a>.</p>
